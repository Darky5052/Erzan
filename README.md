# Dependencies

# How to Setup [Replit]
- If in replit, copy `https://github.com/Darky5052/Erzan.git` & paste it in import from github filename & wait.
- Replit will automatically install needed resources. If it dosen't, you have to install packages manually by `npm i <package>`
- You can put space between the packages to install them together `npm i <package> <package>`
- Or you can also use the replit's own package menu to install recessary packages.
- Then you have to change bot token & mongodb url to your's in config.json (you can follow along in vscode tutorial)
- After completing everything, write `npm run s` or `node index.js` to run. Or just click the run button at the top.

# Hot to Setup [VsCode]
- Follow along youtube series or

- Download project from github `<>Code -> |_|Download Zip`
- Extract File
- I have already Set up package.json in github but if you want new, you can do `npm init` (i do not recommend)
- Change your bot token and setup mongo db url as shown in video
- Run your project using `npm run s` or `node .`/`node index.js`
- `npm run s` is a script that restarts your bot if you have made any changes. You have to have nodemon package installed and have
//  "scripts": {
//    "s": "nodemon index.js"
//  },
 in your 7, 8 & 9th line of package.json

- If your project is still not running then ur a dumba** cause u havent installed node.js yet :D *pls del this line if its working XD
